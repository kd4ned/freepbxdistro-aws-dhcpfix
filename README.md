# FreePBX Distro (SNG7) AWS DHCP Fix

This repository contains a script that should be used as a hook to
dhclient-script on FreePBX Distro (SNG7) systems running under Amazon's
EC2 platform. If your FreePBX Distro server loses Internet connectivity
after about an hour of operation, this should fix it.
